# Advanced Encryption Benchmarking Contract
Illustrates a more advanced benchmarking contract with homomorphic paillier encryption on the entries.


The contract uses an upper and lower bound to validate the entry. Additionally the deploying party may choose an unit (i.e. Mio. â‚¬).
The benchmarkees are deduplicated (one entry per benchmarkee).
The sum is queriable after the 3rd entry at the moment.

The Typescript "Client" is intended for Node.JS usage and proofs at the moment, that connectivity is possible and that the average with multiple account via smart contract matches the locally calculated average.
